It will help prepare you for the other courses. You will need about 10 hours to complete this first course. Writing is a skill and to learn a skill well, you need to practice. In this course, you will watch short video lectures and then practice and discuss what you have learned. Make sure you take good notes and use the peer discussions to ask questions. Then you'll be able to remember the rules you learn in this course when you start writing essays in the next course. </div></h3><div><h1>Syllabus - What you will learn from this course</h1> <h1 class="yy">WEEK 1</h1> <h1>Course Introduction

Verb Tenses and Conjunctions












 </h1><h3><div class="t">In this module, you will watch video lectures, do readings, do practice exercises, and take quizzes. You can re-watch the videos or redo the exercises as many times as you need to to help you understand the material. This module will help you review verb tenses and how to use them correctly. You probably already studied these in your other English classes, so this will just be a quick reminder. Then you'll begin learning about how to use conjunctions in your sentences. This will help you write different kinds of sentences and make your writing more interesting.</div></h3>				</div>			<div class="container text-center ">				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 color2">			<a href="successful.html" class="btn btn-success ba">Enroll</a>			</div>	</div>			</body></html>
