You will be led through a condensed process that acts as a roadmap for developing robust UI/UX design: from ideation and sitemapping, to the creation of paper and digital prototypes. Building on the design skills learned in Visual Elements of User Interface Design, you will apply this methodology to produce a digital prototype for a multi-screen app of your own invention. </div></h3><div><h1>Syllabus - What you will learn from this course</h1> <h1 class="yy">WEEK 1</h1> <h1>Ideation, Articulation, Development



 </h1><h3><div class="tp">Your assignment at the end of this week is the first stage in a multi-step process towards developing a clickable prototype: coming up with a clearly articulated idea for an app with a specific goal in mind. So this week we will focus on how to articulate and structure your ideas and goals, how to use naming and language as a part of your app’s identity. We will also look at audience research and user centered design.


 </div></h3> <h1 style="text-align:center">WEEK 2</h1> <h1 >Planning, Testing, Researching, Mapping



 </h1><h3><div class="t">This week we’re going to continue to develop, plan, and test your app idea. We’ll start by sketching out more extensive content and mapping it into a structure. To test what aspects of your app are working, we’ll look at how to create a non-visual paper prototype and work our way towards a sitemap. While you’re developing the logic of your app, you’ll also begin to develop the look and feel of it: the visual development process.</div></h3>				</div>			<div class="container text-center ">				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 color2">			<a href="successful.html" class="btn btn-success ba">Enroll</a>			</div>	</div>			</body></html>
