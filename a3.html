This course is an introduction to the primary concepts of gaming, and an exploration of how these basic concepts affect the way gamers interact with our games. In this course you will understand what defines a “game” and the mechanics and rules behind different types of games. Through four linked assignments you'll learn ways to create and describe a game concept, and specifically what makes a compelling game. This course focuses on the conceptual underpinnings of games, and all assignments can be completed with a pencil and paper – no previous programming knowledge is required. </div></h3><div><h1>Syllabus - What you will learn from this course</h1> <h1 class="yy">WEEK 1</h1> <h1>The Simplest Games





 </h1><h3><div class="tp">This week we start at the beginning: what are the principles of very simple games, like Hangman and tic-tac-toe? How do these games work? Why do people play them? What are the elements that define games and the gaming experience? And finally, what do games have in common with each other, and what sets them apart? In addition to covering the basics and ground rules for this course, we'll conclude this week with a very simple, low-tech assignment: create a game on a single sheet of paper.


 </div></h3> <h1 style="text-align:center">WEEK 2</h1> <h1 >Rules and Discovery





 </h1><h3><div class="t">How does a player learn the mechanics of your game? How do they learn anything about your game? This week we will talk about the rules that define gameplay, and how those rules are communicated to your players. We also discuss the way rules are bent and broken by players.</div></h3>				</div>			<div class="container text-center ">				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 color2">			<a href="successful.html" class="btn btn-success ba">Enroll</a>			</div>	</div>			</body></html>
