Words and pictures—the building blocks of graphic design—are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the digital world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture. </div></h3><div><h1>Syllabus - What you will learn from this course</h1> <h1 class="yy">WEEK 1</h1> <h1>Fundamentals of Imagemaking
